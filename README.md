The BSOD module will cause every non-admin page on a Backdrop CMS site to return 
a mock "Blue Screen Of Death" if its running on a version of Backdrop CMS
newer than 1.29.

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://docs.backdropcms.org/documentation/extend-with-modules.
